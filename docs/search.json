My lab builds and applies methods, most famously GenomicSEM, an open-source R package that lets researchers pick apart the shared genetics of complex traits (github.com). Day-to-day I juggle genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene-by-environment models, and causal inference methods for the social sciences."

    "text": "How I Got Here\n\nBachelors and Masters in pyschological methos My very early academic education, that is after dropping out of an AI undergrad program,was in psychological methods, where I learned to appriciate a good latent variable, or item response model, and learned to think of every problem as a measurement problem and of strcutura equatino modelign as the path to every solution. Lets jsut say I got good instinct and never was able to shake the bad instincts.\nPhD & early career at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)—I cut my teeth in statistical genetics during a PhD in Biological Psychology and stuck around as post-doc, assistant and then associate professor.\nBristol move—In 2024 I swapped Amsterdam’s canals for Clifton Downs, joining the IEU to scale up multivariate genetics and mentor the next wave of method-geeks."
