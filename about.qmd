Hi there! I’m Michel G. Nivard a Dutch psychologist turned genetic epidemiologist, now happily based at the University of Bristol. I spend my days tinkering with huge DNA datasets, trying to work out how our genes and environments team up to shape behaviour and mental-health.  Below is the “about-page” version of my academic résumé.

## What I’m Doing Now

I hold a chair in **Genetic Epidemiology** at Bristol Medical School’s Population Health Sciences and its Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU). My lab builds and applies methods, most famously **GenomicSEM**, an open-source R package that lets researchers pick apart the shared genetics of complex traits ([github.com][1]). Day-to-day I juggle genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene-by-environment models, and causal inference methods for the social sciences.

## How I Got Here

* **Bachelors and Masters in pyschological methos** My very early academic education, that is after dropping out of an AI undergrad program,was in psychological methods, where I learned to appriciate a good latent variable, or item response model, and learned to think of every problem as a measurement problem and of strcutura equatino modelign as the path to every solution. Lets jsut say I got good instinct and never was able to shake the bad instincts. 

* **PhD & early career at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)**—I cut my teeth in statistical genetics during a PhD in Biological Psychology and stuck around as post-doc, assistant and then associate professor.

* **Bristol move**—In 2024 I swapped Amsterdam's canals for Clifton Downs, joining the IEU to scale up multivariate genetics and mentor the next wave of method-geeks.

## Research in a Nutshell

1. **Multivariate & longitudinal genetics** – Using GenomicSEM and allied tools to map shared genetic influences across psychiatric traits, cognition, and lifestyle ([github.com][1]).
2. **Gene-environment interplay** – From in-utero famine effects on BMI to how retirement frees our internal body-clock, I like models where context matters.
3. **Assortative mating & social genetics** – Recent work explores how genetics nudges partner choice and shapes social networks ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]).

## Highlights I’m Proud Of


* **Early-career Appriciation**: I was awarded the Behavior Genetics Association’s Fuller & Scott Award ([research.vu.nl][4]) and a **Jacobs Foundation Research Fellowship** ([jacobsfoundation.org][5]).
* **Community builder**: co-founded the **Genetics Network Amsterdam (GENE)** to connect social-science geneticists across Dutch universities ([geneticsnetworkamsterdam.org][6]).
